Constructing the symbolic component of a neurosymbolic system using interpretability techniques applied to neural models offers a transformative dual advantage, particularly in automating complex software engineering tasks. Neural models excel in areas like code generation, bug fixing, and program repair due to their probabilistic nature and ability to learn from large-scale data. However, their inherent opacity limits trust, usability, and systematic refinement. By applying interpretability techniques, such as saliency mapping, attention visualization, or feature attribution, developers can demystify these models, gaining valuable insights into their internal decision-making processes and outputs. This enhanced understanding not only fosters trust but also streamlines debugging and optimization, ensuring these models are more effective and reliable.

Additionally, interpretability enables the extraction of meaningful patterns, logic, and relationships from neural models, which can be encoded as a symbolic component in the neurosymbolic system. This integration addresses the limitations of purely probabilistic approaches by introducing symbolic reasoning, which is inherently fast, deterministic, and robust. The symbolic layer complements the adaptability of neural networks with its precision and reliability, creating a balanced, high-performing hybrid system. Together, these advancements bridge the gap between machine learning and human understanding, offering scalable, efficient, and explainable AI-driven solutions tailored to the evolving needs of software engineering.
